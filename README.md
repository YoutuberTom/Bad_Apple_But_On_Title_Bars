**Some facts while making this project:**
- While watching youtube, I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-DUBjQPgTM&t=26s) and thought it looks fun, why don't I make one myself.
- After some research, I found out that pygame can create multiple screens but it still in development, so I might need to update this later (if I remember).
- I have to thank [nutel65](https://github.com/nutel65) for this idea:D
