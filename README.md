**Some facts while making this project:**
- While watching youtube, I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-DUBjQPgTM&t=26s) and thought it looks fun, why don't I make one myself
- After some research, I found out that pygame can create multiple screens but it still in development, so I might need to update this later(if i remember)
- I have to thank [nutel65](https://github.com/nutel65) for this idea:D

**Requirements:**
- **Python** - Not tested yet but it shouldn't be too low
- **Window os** - Not tested in other platforms yet
- **Hardware** - Don't run this project on too poor hardware, since you will experience a lot of lag

**Requirements for the Python package:**
- **pygame** - To install just type **pip install pygame** or **pip3 install pygame**
